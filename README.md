# Estimating Earthquake Locations Using Twitter Data and Affinity Propagation

Seismographs (instruments used for recording seismic signals) continuously record velocity of ground motions at different locations. When the ground shaking at a particular seismic station exceeds a predefined threshold, a seismograph gets triggered and transmit an alert to a data center. Triggering of multiple instruments at different stations over an area within a relatively short period of time usually indicates the occurrence of an earthquake. The transmitted seismic signals from multiple stations need to be processed further to estimate the earthquake hypocenter.

However, this process can be time-consuming (takes a few to several minutes) and moreover there are many places around the world with not a good coverage of seismic stations. 

The main idea here is to use the first order reports of an earthquake occurrence in the social media by people who actually felt it, for a rapid/rough estimation of earthquake location. Due to the speed of post creations and ease of near real-time access, using social media such as Twitter can be a potential for gaining situational awareness following disasters.

Here I present a simple way to do this without any need for steam of the data or NLP or training data set.

# Part 1: getting data from Twitter
There are several ways to do this. Here I use `tweepy`
You need to create an account for Twitter API first and use your consumer and access information for connecting the Twitter API. (here I deleted mine!)


we search Twitter API for the word "earthquake" in 23 different languages:

`search_phrases = ['earthquake', 'sismo', 
                     'quake', 'temblor',
                     'terremoto', 'tremblement',
                     'erdbeben', 'deprem',
                     'σεισμός', 'seismós',
                     'séisme', 'zemljotres',
                     'potres', 'terremot',
                     'jordskjelv', 'cutremur',
                     'aardbeving', '地震',
                     'भूकंप', 'زلزال', 
                     'tremor', '지진', 'زلزله' ]`
                     
Our goal is to detect earthquakes based on evidences of firsthand felt reports from Twitter. So we need to identify tweets originating from users who experienced earthquake shaking like this one:

![the tweets we are looking for](F.png)

To minimize such contamination with the twitter activities following the release of news or blog articles, we remove all tweets that contain Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), specifically the
string “http”. 

Furthermore, we remove all tweets with the text “RT” or “@”. “RT” is commonly used to identify a tweet 
as a rebroadcast or “retweet” of another users tweet and the “@” symbol is used in front of a username to reply to another user’s tweet. 
Thus tweets containing “@” and “RT” are likely to arise from a user commenting on an earthquake from outside the felt area.

Filtering tweets with these keywords out, we archive the tweet creation time, text, and coordinates into a dataframe.

# Clustering

I use affinity propagation (Frey and Dueck, 2007) for the clustering. 
This method is based on the concept of "message passing" between data points and finds "examplars" of the input set that are representative of clusters.

![affinity propagation](F5.png)

AP simultaneously considers all data points as potential exemplars. Considering each data point as a node in
a network, this method recursively transmits real-valued messages (similarity measurements) along edges of the network until a good set of exemplars and corresponding clusters emerges.

I use this algorithem because unlike other clustering algorithms such as k-means, affinity propagation does not require the number of clusters to be determined or estimated before running the algorithm.

Not bad, yeah
